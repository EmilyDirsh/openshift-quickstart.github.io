            <h1>What's a Quickstart?</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
            A quickstart is an application configured to run on OpenShift, along with some metadata that tells OpenShift which cartridges it needs. 
        </p>

    <p>
        Quickstarts automate a number of steps you would otherwise have to do manually: 
        <ol>
            <li>Create a new application with a specific runtime </li>
            <li>Add a database cartridge and any other required cartridges </li>
            <li>Clone the application repo locally </li>
            <li>Overwrite the default repo with a pre-configured application </li>
            <li>Push the new code to OpenShift</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        A quickstart is not a cartridge: 
        <ul>
            <li>a quickstart can depend on multiple cartridges, so it's useful for things like applications that require both a runtime and a database</li>
            <li>quickstarts don't have as much functionality or flexibility at the system level as cartridges - they have to rely on their required cartridges for that.</li>
            <li>quickstarts are less complicated, so easier to build than cartridges</li>
            <li><strong>quickstarts do not receive any automated maintenance or security updates</strong></li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>With RHC</h2>
    <p>
        If you have <a href="#">rhc</a> installed and setup, you can create a new application from a quickstart with the <code>rhc app create</code> command.
    </p>
    <p>
        First, you'll need to know
        <ol>
            <li>The URL for the quickstart's git repo</li>
            <li>The cartridges the quickstart requires</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        Then, you simply run the following command, substituting the above information:
        <pre><code>rhc app create [app name] [cartridges] --from-code=[git url]</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        As an example, here's how you can launch a new application using the meteor quickstart:
        <pre><code>rhc app create meteor nodejs-0.10 mongodb-2.2 --from-code=https://github.com/openshift-quickstart/openshift-meteorjs-quickstart.git</code></pre>
    </p>

    <h2>With the console</h2>
    <p>
        The OpenShift Online web console has a number of quickstarts available as options when you create a new application.
    </p>
    <p>
        TODO: configure origin console to use specific quickstarts?

            Don't see the quickstart you want? It's easy to build your own. Check out an <a href="#">existing quickstart</a> to see what's involved, especially the action hooks, and <a href="#">read the documentation</a> for detailed instructions.
